# Go-Game
A challenge set by my programming lecturer to create a version of the board game, Go, and implement a graphical front-end. No comments yet.

File to play is currently: Go(Playable 1.1)

Created by Flynn Acworth and Felix Carvisiglia

The image needed to play the game is below. It must be named 'Blank_Go_board.png' for the code to function.
